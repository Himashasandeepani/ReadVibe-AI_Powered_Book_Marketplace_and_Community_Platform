          <Card.Text>
            Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their
            settings. You can usually:
          </Card.Text>
          <ul>
            <li>View the cookies stored on your device and delete them.</li>
            <li>Block cookies from all or specific sites.</li>
            <li>
              Set preferences to be asked each time a site wants to set a
              cookie.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <Card.Text>
            Please refer to your browser's "Help" section for instructions. Be
            aware that blocking essential cookies may prevent parts of the
            ReadVibe website from functioning correctly.
